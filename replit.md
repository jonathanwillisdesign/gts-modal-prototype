# Overview

This is a full-stack web application built with a React frontend and Express backend. The project appears to be in an early stage, currently rendering a Dialog/modal component as its main page. It follows a monorepo-style structure with shared code between client and server. The app uses a PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for data management, and the frontend is built with shadcn/ui components on top of Tailwind CSS.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Project Structure
- **`client/`** — React single-page application (SPA)
- **`server/`** — Express.js backend API server
- **`shared/`** — Code shared between client and server (database schema, types)
- **`migrations/`** — Database migration files generated by Drizzle Kit

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework:** React with TypeScript (non-RSC, client-side rendering)
- **Bundler:** Vite, with HMR proxied through the Express server in development
- **Routing:** Wouter (lightweight client-side router)
- **State Management:** TanStack React Query for server state; no separate client state library
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui (new-york style) built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming (supports light/dark mode via HSL variables)
- **Path Aliases:** `@/` maps to `client/src/`, `@shared/` maps to `shared/`

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework:** Express.js running on Node with TypeScript (via tsx in dev, esbuild bundle for production)
- **API Pattern:** All API routes are prefixed with `/api` and registered in `server/routes.ts`
- **Storage Layer:** Abstracted behind an `IStorage` interface in `server/storage.ts`. Currently uses an in-memory implementation (`MemStorage`), designed to be swapped for a database-backed implementation
- **Dev Server:** In development, Vite middleware is attached to Express for HMR. In production, static files are served from `dist/public`

### Database
- **ORM:** Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Connection:** Uses `@neondatabase/serverless` (Neon Postgres) via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- **Schema:** Defined in `shared/schema.ts` using Drizzle's `pgTable` helpers
- **Validation:** Zod schemas auto-generated from Drizzle schemas via `drizzle-zod`
- **Migrations:** Managed with `drizzle-kit push` (schema push approach, not file-based migrations)
- **Current Schema:** A `users` table with `id` (UUID, auto-generated), `username` (unique text), and `password` (text)

### Authentication
- **Session Store:** `connect-pg-simple` is listed as a dependency, indicating PostgreSQL-backed session storage is planned or available
- **Current State:** No auth routes are implemented yet; the routes file has placeholder comments

### Build & Deploy
- **Dev:** `npm run dev` runs the Express server with tsx, which serves both the API and Vite dev middleware
- **Build:** `npm run build` runs Vite build for the frontend and esbuild for the server bundle
- **Production:** `npm start` runs the bundled server from `dist/index.js`, serving static files from `dist/public`
- **Type Check:** `npm run check` runs TypeScript compiler without emitting

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Shared schema between frontend and backend** — The Drizzle schema in `shared/schema.ts` generates both database types and Zod validation schemas, ensuring type safety across the stack
2. **Storage interface pattern** — The `IStorage` interface decouples business logic from the data layer, making it easy to swap between in-memory storage (for prototyping) and database storage
3. **Single server for everything** — Express serves both the API and the frontend (via Vite in dev, static files in prod), simplifying deployment
4. **API request helper** — `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` provides a centralized `apiRequest` function with error handling and a configurable query function factory for React Query

## External Dependencies

### Database
